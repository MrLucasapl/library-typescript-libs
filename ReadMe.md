Installation
Install the dependencies and devDependencies

npm install

How to use Start the server

initializing the front-end
npm run dev

initializing the back-end
npm run server

After installing the dependencies and starting the servers, just access the address that appears in your terminal (usually http://localhost:5173/) The site has a protection system so that users who are not logged in do not have access to pages other than the Login page, so you will be immediately redirected to it, the user and password are:

email: admin@admin.com.br
password: Admin7242

Both can be changed directly by the db.json file

Once logged in, you have access to all pages on the site, being able to change and add new books, search and order in ascending or descending order.
